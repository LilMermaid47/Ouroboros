    questDescription: "\u201C Well, well, what do we have here?\r\nAm I a liar, you
      wonder? \r\nA jester poking amidst mortals whose bones will be shortly cleaned
      or merely an intruder who came into this town to kill you all. \r\nIs it the
      same thing? \r\nHaha, which one did you want? \r\nI would be end soon enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2026\r\n\r\nWhy
      did my pig be here?\u201D\r\n"
    choice1Name: Kill them
    choice1Description: They'll never get us!
    choice1Reveal: The Monkey King almost destroyed the city. The monsters flee when
      their master has been killed. The Huangsei are helping to rebuild the houses
      in the village, even those of the Susoda clan. Yu and her people tend to the
      wounded, even those in the Huangsei clan. It's all over. The gods saved us.
      The gods listened to our prayers because we kept the balance.
    choice2Name: "Bendan\u2019s pig"
    choice2Description: Am I completely crazy? Will I leave the fate of the Temple
      in the hands, or rather the hooves of Bendan's pig?
    choice2Reveal: "The pig transforms into a man with a delicate and balanced appearance.
      It's the Perfectly self-awakened, say some. It's The Blessed one, shout others.
      He came to save us. Then, like a sage, he snaps his fingers. At the same time,
      all the demons disappeared\u2014even the Monkey king. Our Master probably imprisoned
      him for his crimes against the gods. It's all over. I can\u2019t believe we
      are saved without any damage. Except for one: Bendan has never been seen since."
