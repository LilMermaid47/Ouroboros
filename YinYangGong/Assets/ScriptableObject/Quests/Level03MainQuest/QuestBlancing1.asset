    questDescription: "A Huapigui! I saw a Huapigui! It stole the skin of my wife.
      It attempted to seduce me, but I am no fool. I tried to kill it, but only magic
      can kill it, and I do not know how to wield it.\r\nAfter that, it ate my child.
      My poor little girl.\r\nPlease help me avenge my family.\r"
    choice1Name: Chase it
    choice1Description: We need to build a little army and find the lair of the Huapigui.
      Show it who rules the land.
    choice1Reveal: The Huapigui stole the skin from a few people, and it left its
      lair. We kept the gold and the tools for ourselves.
    choice2Name: Kill it.
    choice2Description: We must find the ghost and kill it with our magic. If we
      are lucky, killing it could give us some ghost powder and help us create powerful
      potions.
    choice2Reveal: The Huapigui was defeated with a powerful ritual that left a lot
      of ghost powder. With the powerful potions created with the ghost powder, the
      army will have many more resources in battle.
