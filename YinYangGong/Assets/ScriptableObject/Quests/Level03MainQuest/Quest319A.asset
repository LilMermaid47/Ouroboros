    questDescription: "\u201C I was flying quietly from one mountain to another when
      I saw your ghetto. On the other hand, the Temple here is magnificent and would
      make a nice home for me. Besides, there is a village of mortals ready to serve
      me.\r\nOr maybe I don't want to stay here. Maybe I'm hungry and would leave
      if fed your delicious followers. The <b>mallows</b> look exquisite. They have
      a little something that makes me want to shove some down my throat.\u201D\r"
