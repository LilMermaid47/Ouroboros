    questDescription: "\u201C I have some news regarding the <color=#0BB5FF>child
      theft investigation</color>. I managed to find the thief and follow him to
      his lair. The <color=#0BB5FF>thief is a nine-tailed species of a lavender fox</color>
      with a spooky appearance. I'm sorry, but he's hiding in <color=#AB82FF>Susoda</color>
      territory.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhat are you going to do with this information?\r\nWhich
      clan are you going to join?\r\n"
    choice1Name: Huangsei
    choice1Description: The Huangsei clan will be happy to help us find the culprit.
    choice1Reveal: 'The Patriarch had offered us several soldiers who have joined
      our ranks. The Susoda clan denied the charges, and <color=#0BB5FF>the fox was
      never seen in the village again</color> . Is this a victory?

      We made a deal with her. The Susoda clan offers us wealth and magical artifacts.

      to the village again</color> .
