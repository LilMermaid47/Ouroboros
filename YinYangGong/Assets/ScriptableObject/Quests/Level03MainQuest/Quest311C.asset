    questDescription: "\u201C I have some news regarding the child theft investigation.
      I managed to find the thief and follow him to his lair. The thief is a nine-tailed
      species of a lavender fox with a spooky appearance. I'm sorry, but he's hiding
      in Susoda territory.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhat are you going to do with this information?\r\nWhich
      clan are you going to join?\r\n"
    choice1Name: Huangsei
    choice1Description: The Huangsei clan will be happy to help us find the culprit.
    choice1Reveal: The Patriarch had offered us several soldiers who have joined
      our ranks. The Susoda clan denied the charges, and the fox was never seen in
      the village again. Is this a victory?
    choice2Name: Susoda
    choice2Description: Maybe we should talk to the matriarch about this before we
      do anything.
    choice2Reveal: Yu, the head of Susoda clan, is happy that we joined her personally.
      We made a deal with her. The Susoda clan offers us wealth and magical artifacts.
      In exchange, she promised us that the fox would never return to the village
      again.
