    questDescription: "\u201C Well, well, what do we have here?\r\nAm I a liar, you
      wonder? \r\nA jester poking amidst mortals whose bones will be shortly cleaned
      or merely an intruder who came into this town to <color=#FF6666>kill you all.
      </color>\r\nIs it the same thing? \r\nHaha, which one did you want? \r\nI would
      be end soon enough.\u201D\r"

    choice1Reveal: The Monkey King almost destroyed the city. The monsters flee when
      their master has been killed. The <color=#ca9c43>Huangsei</color>  are helping
      to rebuild the houses in the village, even those of the <color=#AB82FF>Susoda</color>
