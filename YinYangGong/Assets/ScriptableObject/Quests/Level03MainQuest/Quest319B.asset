    questDescription: "\u201CI was flying quietly from one mountain to another when
      I saw your magnificent town. Oh, and the Temple here is grandiose! \r\nCan
      I visit it? I want to see the statues, the porcelains, and the gems decorating
      all the walls. Please let me in. I want to see it. I want to grab some of your
      treasures and keep them for myself! \u201C\r"

      makes me cringe oddly.
