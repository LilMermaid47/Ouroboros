    questDescription: "\u201C Did you miss me? I left the village for a while to
      <color=#0BB5FF>mourn the death of my favorite pig</color> The gods listened
      to my prayers and gave me a <color=#0BB5FF>brand-new piglet</color>. Look at
      its beautiful face with a delicious snout.\r\nI need <color=#0BB5FF>magic truffles</color>
      to feed him. This fat pig has expensive tastes. But, unfortunately, it's too
      costly for me. \u201D\r\n"
    choice1Name: Capture the pig
    choice1Description: This pig is <color=#0BB5FF>strange and possibly dangerous</color>.
      We can't leave Bendan with this thing.
    choice1Reveal: 'The pig turned into a <color=#FF6666>demonic boar</color>. It
      smashed through a wall of the Temple before flying away with a few shredded
      followers in its mouth. Bendan mourns the departure of his new friend and continues
      to deny responsibility.
