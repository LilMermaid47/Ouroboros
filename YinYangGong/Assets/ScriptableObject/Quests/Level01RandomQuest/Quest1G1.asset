    questName: Mother Tree
    questGiverName: Yu, the matriarch of Susoda clan
    questDescription: "\u201CThe leaves of our mother tree are turning black and
      falling. Our prayers are useless. We must try another remedy. Otherwise, I
      fear that a curse will fall on our community. The last time, women stop having
      children.\u201D"
    choice1Name: Contact the Shamans of the West
    choice1Description: Shamans have more advanced knowledge about diseased trees.
      Bringing one to the village should help us heal the tree, but they live <b>far
      away</b>.
    choice1Reveal: On his way to the village, the shaman was attacked and never reached
      his destination. The mother tree of Susoda is stunted and dry. So there's not
      much more to do with it.
    choice2Name: Cut the tree
    choice2Description: The tree is a lost cause. It should be cut down before the
      wood goes moldy.
    choice2Reveal: Yu angers the loggers who cut down the tree. We sold the magical
      wood. The Susoda clan is furious with the temple.
