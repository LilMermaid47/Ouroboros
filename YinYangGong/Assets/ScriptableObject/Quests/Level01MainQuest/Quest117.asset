    choice1Name: Ancient monks
    choice1Description: Many say that we should ask for help from the ancient monks.
      Those who dwell in the <b>mountain of fire</b>. Their wisdom and magic can
      help the village.
    choice1Reveal: The fighting abilities of the monks are extraordinary! The village
      is in good hands. The Huangsei clan offered to welcome our new allies who joined
      their clan without problems.
    choice2Name: Wolves
    choice2Description: Others think that the wolves that ransack the chicken coops
      should be domesticated. This way, we solve <b>two problems</b> at once by training
      them to fight.
    choice2Reveal: Wolf training didn't go as planned. They attacked several villagers.
      The project almost fell through, but the Susodas insisted on taking over the
      project. They trained about ten wolves.
