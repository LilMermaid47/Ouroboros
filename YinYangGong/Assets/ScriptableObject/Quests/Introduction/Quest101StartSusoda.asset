    questDescription: '"Several villagers request an audience with the Temple. Answer
      to the best of your knowledge, and try not to favor one clan too much."


      We
      were to meet the villagers who had been waiting for several hours, but the
      <b>magistrate Liliang</b> deigned to offer us her presence, a rare thing. You
      remember that she is the <b>official leader</b> of the village. She rarely
      leaves her wealth-filled palace to go to the common people. Maybe <b>yesterday''s
      demon attack</b> made her realize how dangerous our warnings were.'
