    questDescription: '"My dear apprentice, it is time for you to become the <color=#0BB5FF>head
      of the Temple</color>. I''m getting old, and I feel my body and mind losing
      balance. Soon I''ll be dust in the wind.

      counting on you. We, the Temple, <color=#0BB5FF>counsel and assist the community</color>.
      You will also take my role as mediator. The two clans living in the village
      have <color=#FF6666>hated each other</color> for millennia. A simple argument
      can quickly turn into a bloodbath. Don''t be fooled by them.


      Do you
      understand?'
