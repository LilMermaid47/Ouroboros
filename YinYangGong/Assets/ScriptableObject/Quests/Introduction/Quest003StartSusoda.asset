    questDescription: "We were to meet the villagers who had been waiting for several
      hours, but the <color=#0BB5FF>magistrate Liliang</color> deigned to offer us
      her presence, a rare thing. You remember that she is the <color=#0BB5FF>official
      leader</color> of the village. She rarely leaves her wealth-filled palace to
      go to the common people. Maybe <color=#FF6666>yesterday's demon attack</color>
      made her realize how dangerous our warnings were.\r\n\r\nRemember, she likes
      money and big projetcs. Be sure to have <color=#0BB5FF>Yuan</color><sprite
      name=argentLogo>  when she comes to see us.\r"
