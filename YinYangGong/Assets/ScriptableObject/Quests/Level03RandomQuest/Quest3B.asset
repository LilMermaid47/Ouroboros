    questDescription: "\u201C I have just returned from a courtesy visit to the neighbouring
      village. I'm completely jealous of their new weaponry. We don't have the means
      to buy better ones. I suggest we attack them and rob them.\u201D"
    choice1Name: Accept
    choice1Description: They've been laughing at us for years. Prepare our soldiers.
    choice1Reveal: We'd lost a few disciples, but the village had more weapons than
      it needed. The Huangsei clan disagrees.
    choice2Name: Refuse
    choice2Description: "I cannot accept it. I have to pray to the gods for the magistrate\u2019s
      lack of morality."
    choice2Reveal: 'The magistrate left the temple disappointed with the lack of
