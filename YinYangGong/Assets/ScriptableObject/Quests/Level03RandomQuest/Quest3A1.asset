    questDescription: "\u201C O dear Master Fangshi, I want to gift you a magnificent
      lion statue. We found it in an old abandoned temple and I immediately thought
      of you when I saw it.\u201D"
    choice1Name: Sell it
    choice1Description: It's very kind of the Huangsei clan, but we need money.
    choice1Reveal: This statue was worth a jackpot. The Huangsei clan is insulted
      by our gesture.

    choice2Description: It will go very well with the statues of the temple. Hopefully,
      it attracts followers.
    choice2Reveal: The temple is doing better since the statue arrived in the village.
