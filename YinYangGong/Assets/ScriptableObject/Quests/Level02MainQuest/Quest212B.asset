    questDescription: "\u201C Master Fangshi, we have a <color=#0BB5FF>problem with
      our crops</color>. They all perished that night without any warning sign. The
      <color=#AB82FF>Susoda</color> clan thinks it is the <color=#0BB5FF>jade cabbage</color>,
      while the <color=#ca9c43>Huangsei</color> clan accuses the <color=#AB82FF>Susoda</color>
      clan of <color=#0BB5FF>poisoning crops</color> to promote their garden. Who
      are the culprits, in your opinion?\u201D"
    choice1Name: The cabbage
    choice1Description: "We need to get rid of this cabbage before it's too late.
      Its magical aura is disturbing. Let's destroy it even if it\u2019s <color=#FF6666>dangerous</color>."
    choice1Reveal: 'When trying to destroy the artifact, it exploded on the first
      hit. Several villagers and <color=#ca9c43>Huangsei</color> members were injured.
      At least the cabbage seems to be gone.

    choice2Name: Susoda clan
    choice2Description: That wouldn't be surprising coming from the <color=#AB82FF>Susoda</color>
      clan. They did something unsavory and have to pay the consequences.
    choice2Reveal: 'The <color=#AB82FF>Susoda</color> clan denied the charges. They
      finally agreed to offer their harvests free of charge to the villages. Strangely,
      the cabbage disappeared without a trace.
