    questDescription: "\u201C Master Fangshi, we have a<b> problem with our crops</b>.
      They all perished that night without any warning sign. The Susoda Clan thinks
      it is the <b>jade cabbage</b>, while the Huangsei Clan accuses the Susoda Clan
      of <b>poisoning crops</b> to promote their garden. Who are the culprits, in
      your opinion?\u201D"
    choice1Name: The cabbage
    choice1Description: "We need to get rid of this cabbage before it's too late.
      Its magical aura is disturbing. Let's destroy it even if it\u2019s dangerous."
    choice1Reveal: When trying to destroy the artifact, it exploded on the first
      hit. Several villagers and Huangsei members were injured. At least the cabbage
      seems to be gone.
    choice2Name: Susoda clan
    choice2Description: That wouldn't be surprising coming from the Susoda clan.
      They did something unsavory and have to pay the consequences.
    choice2Reveal: The Susoda clan denied the charges. They finally agreed to offer
      their harvests free of charge to the villages. Strangely, the cabbage disappeared
      without a trace.
