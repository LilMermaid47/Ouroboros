      is in good hands. The Huangsei clan offered to host our new allies who joined
      their clan without problems.
    choice2Name: Wolves
    choice2Description: Others think that the wolves that ransack the chicken coops
      should be domesticated. In this way, we solve two problems at once.

      project. They trained about ten wolves.
