    questDescription: "We have to find a new way to defend ourselves. Our militia
      is not enough. I need your advice.\r"
    choice1Name: Ancient monks
    choice1Description: "Many offer help from ancient monks. Those who dwell in the
      mountain of fire. Their wisdom and magic can help the village.\r"
    choice1Reveal: The fighting abilities of the monks are extraordinary! The village
      is in good hands. The Huangsei clan offered to host our new allies who joined
      their clan without problems.
    choice2Name: Wolves
    choice2Description: Others think that the wolves that ransack the chicken coops
      should be domesticated. In this way, we solve two problems at once.
    choice2Reveal: Wolf training didn't go as planned. They attacked several villagers.
      The project almost fell through, but the Susodas insisted on taking over the
      project. They trained about ten wolves.
